description: A guide to start using the sahithyan/utils library.

sahithyan/utils is a copy-pastable library of code blocks. You don't install
anything; just copy-paste the required functions and be done. No more
maintenance.

Currently the library provide code in typescript. In the future, if it needs to,
javascript code will be included as well.

## Why

I found myself copying utility functions from one project to another. It was
not-so-efficient.

Usually, we may want to publish the functions as a package to npm or jsr. But we
don't always want all the functions in all of our projects. To avoid that issue,
we can split up the package into smaller packages. That introduces too much of
packages to manage.
