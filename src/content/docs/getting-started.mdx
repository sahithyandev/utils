description: A guide to start using the sahithyan/utils library.
---

sahithyan/utils is a community-driven copy-pastable library of code blocks. You
don't install anything; just copy-paste the required functions and be done. No
more utility libraries to keep track of.

Currently the library provides code in TypeScript. In future, JavaScript code
might be included as well.

## Why

I found myself copying utility functions from one project to another. It was
not-so-efficient.

Usually, we may want to publish the functions as a package to npm or jsr. But we
don't always want all the functions in all of our projects. To avoid that issue,
we can split up the package into smaller packages. That introduces too much of
packages to manage.
