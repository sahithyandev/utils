## What's this?

sahithyan/utils is a copy-pastable library of code blocks. You don't install
anything; just copy-paste the required functions and be done. No more utility
libraries to keep track of.

<AvailableLanguages languages={[{name: "TypeScript", url: "/ts/", }]} />

## Why?

I found myself copying utility functions from one project to another. It was
not-so-efficient.

Usually, we may want to publish the functions as a package to npm or jsr. But we
don't always want all the functions in all of our projects. To avoid that issue,
we can split up the package into smaller packages. That introduces too much of
packages to manage.

Heavily inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

## How to use?

You just find and copy the function you want to use. **You don't install
anything**.

## How to contribute?
